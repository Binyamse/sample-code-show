Run  Local Deployment

 Local Deployment
This script is designed to manage and deploy  services on Minikube. It provides a comprehensive set of features to deploy individual services or groups, manage CI/CD configurations, and deploy or remove specific tools.

Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Minikube installed and configured on your system.
Install the necessary Python packages, including google-cloud-storage, kubernetes, and pyyaml.
Environment Variables
Before running the script, ensure the following environment variables are set:

BUILD_WORK_DIR: Path to the build working directory.
Usage
The script offers a series of global options and subcommands that allow flexible management of deployments, tools, and configurations.

Global Options
These options can be used independently or in combination:

--build-test <service>: Run build-test for a specific service.
--deploy <service>: Deploy a specific service.
--deploy-group <group-name>: Deploy all services within a specified group.
--tools <tool-name>: Deploy specific tools to Minikube. Options include: mongo, elastic, redis, istio, prometheus, all.
--cicd <config-type>: Deploy CI/CD related configurations to Minikube. Options include: all, secret, configmap.
--remove-tools <tool-name>: Remove specific tools from Minikube. Options include: mongo, elastic, redis, istio, prometheus, all.
Commands
Commands are standalone operations that can be executed independently of global options:

remove <service>: Remove a specific deployed service.
stop: Stop Minikube.
start: Start Minikube.
reset: Reset all Minikube components.
Command Examples

python3 run_local --deploy service
Deploy a Group:

python3 run_local --deploy-group group-name
Deploy a Service with Tools and CI/CD Configurations:

python3 run_local --deploy service --tools mongo --cicd secret
Deploy a Group with Specific Tools:
